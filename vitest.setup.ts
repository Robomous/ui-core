/**
 * Unmount between tests, and let the unmount finish.
 *
 * `@testing-library/react` registers `cleanup` itself when a runner exposes
 * `afterEach` as a global. This suite runs with `globals: false` — imports in a
 * test file should say what the file uses — so the hook has to be registered by
 * hand. Without it every render accumulates in one `document.body` and a query
 * like `getByRole("alert")` starts failing with "found multiple elements" in
 * whichever test happens to run second. That is a harness bug that reads exactly
 * like a component bug, which is why it is worth a file and a comment.
 *
 * The drained macrotask is for work an unmount schedules rather than does.
 * Radix's focus scope returns focus from a `setTimeout(…, 0)` registered by its
 * unmount cleanup, so after `cleanup()` that timer is still pending. It fires
 * into the next test's first millisecond, and after a file's last test it races
 * the environment teardown: vitest tears jsdom down inside the worker's `stop`
 * message handler, libuv serves I/O callbacks before the next timers phase, and a
 * starved worker therefore wakes to the teardown first. The timer then builds a
 * `CustomEvent` from Node's restored global and dispatches it on a jsdom element,
 * which jsdom rejects — an uncaught `TypeError` that fails the run with every
 * test green. A timer scheduled here, after the radix one and for the same
 * duration, fires after it, so awaiting it is the guarantee that the document the
 * unmount targets is still there. `harness.test.tsx` asserts the property.

 * in that store, so a toast fired in one test reappears beside the next test's

 * Give `FormData` back to the realm that owns `fetch`.

 * while leaving `fetch`, `Request` and `Response` as Node's (undici). The two do
 * not recognise each other: `new Request(url, { body: <jsdom FormData> })`
 * silently **stringifies** it, so a multipart upload arrives as
 * `text/plain: "[object FormData]"`.
 *
 * That is a realm mismatch and not a product bug — in a browser both come from the
 * same place — but it makes an upload untestable, and worse, it makes a *correct*
 * upload look exactly like the `[object File]` bug a missing `bodySerializer`
 * produces. So the realms are reconciled here rather than worked around in each
 * test.

 * That is the worst shape a failure has: vitest reports "83 passed, 1 error" and
 * names a test that was already green. It reproduced only in CI at first, because
 * whether the effect resolves before the environment is torn down is a race.
 *
 * The stand-in is a counter rather than a no-op, so a test can still assert that a

/**
 * `localStorage`, which Node 26 declares on the global and leaves `undefined`.
 *
 * The fifth gap of this species in this file, and the first that comes from the
 * runtime rather than from jsdom. Node declares the property while
 * `--localstorage-file` is absent, so vitest's jsdom environment finds the key
 * already taken and never installs jsdom's own — the property reads as
 * `undefined` and `localStorage.getItem(...)` is a `TypeError` on a property
 * read, not a storage that accepts writes and forgets them.
 *
 * `sessionStorage` is declared by Node too, and vitest skips it for the same
 * reason — so that global is *Node's* `Storage`, not jsdom's. It is unaffected
 * only because Node's `sessionStorage` works with no flag while its
 * `localStorage` is `undefined` without `--localstorage-file`. That is why
 * `data/session.ts` and its tests pass under both majors while
 * `data/railState.ts` and `data/prefs.ts` do not. Any explanation predicting
 * both would break is wrong.
 *
 * The product code needs nothing: `storage()` in both modules probes with a write
 * and answers `null` from its `catch`, so the caller already gets the default —
 * the behaviour that guard exists for, arriving through a cause nobody
 * anticipated. What has no `localStorage` is the eight test *bodies*, which reach
 * the property directly, as a browser lets them.
 *
 * Assigned on a `typeof` check rather than with `??=`: a property that is
 * declared and `undefined` satisfies neither `??=` nor a call, which is exactly
 * this case — the same point the `URL.createObjectURL` note above makes about a
 * jsdom release.
 *
 * The stand-in is jsdom's real `Storage` rather than a hand-rolled `Map`, because
 * `railState.test.ts` asserts the availability probe **leaves nothing behind**:
 * a stub that swallowed writes would turn that test green while proving nothing.
 * A `url` is mandatory — jsdom's default `about:blank` is an opaque origin and
 * throws `SecurityError` on the first access. Setup runs per test file, so each
 * worker gets its own empty store and nothing is shared across them, so long as
 * files stay isolated, which is vitest's default. Passing `--localstorage-file`
 * is not the fix, tempting as it looks for the `ExperimentalWarning` this block
 * leaves behind: it makes the `typeof` check above pass, so this block is
 * skipped, and the suite runs against Node's one process-wide on-disk store —
 * `railState.test.ts`'s `afterEach` `clear()` would wipe a concurrently running
 * file's data.
